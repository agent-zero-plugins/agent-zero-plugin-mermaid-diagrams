"""Publish this plugin's capability nudge as an enumerable PromptFragment.

The nudge describes the CHAT UI's rendering capability, not an A0-native tool,
so it is UNBOUND (no binds_to_tools/binds_to_mcp) — any harness sharing the UI
may relay it. Native agents keep receiving it via this plugin's own
system_prompt extension; this hook makes it ENUMERABLE so non-native harnesses
(the Claude bridge) and scoping UIs can see and relay it. No-op on an A0
without the helpers.prompt_fragments seam.

The nudge text is read from the sibling system_prompt module by AST-extracting
the module-level string constant — NOT by importing/exec'ing that module, which
would pull in `from agent import ...` (heavy, and re-run every dispatch). AST
keeps this import-free, fast, and unit-testable without an A0 runtime.
